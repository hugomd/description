# Micro Description
A microservice to get the description of a GitHub repository ✍️

# Usage
```
GET https://d.now.sh/USER/REPO
```

# Why?
The description of a GitHub repo is normally the foundation of my projects and is where I narrow my idea down. I tend to use the same description across the `package.json` and `readme.md`, and unfortunately, GitHub doesn't show you the description just after creating a repository.
