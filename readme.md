# Micro Description [![Build Status](https://drone.ii.md/api/badges/hugomd/micro-description/status.svg)](https://drone.ii.md/hugomd/micro-description)
A microservice to get the description of a GitHub repository ‚úçÔ∏è

# Usage
```
GET https://d.now.sh/USER/REPO
```

# Why?
The description of a GitHub repo is normally the foundation of my projects and is where I narrow my idea down. I tend to use the same description across the `package.json` and `readme.md`, and unfortunately, GitHub doesn't show you the description just after creating a repository.

# Contributing
If you'd like to contribute (you can skip a few of these steps if you'd like üòâ):
1. Clone the repo
2. Make a new local branch
3. Change what you'd like
4. Write some tests
5. Make a Pull Request!
